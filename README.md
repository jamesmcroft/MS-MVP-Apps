## Contributing üöÄ

All developers can contribute to the project. However, a Microsoft MVP profile is required to use the application. This may make it difficult to debug and test if you are not a current active Microsoft MVP.

The application has been rebuilt on the [Uno Platform](https://platform.uno) to make it available on all platforms while taking advantage of Windows XAML.

Want to help us build? Take a look through our [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md). We actively encourage you to jump in and help with any issues!

### Getting started ‚≠ê
